    "When you download the data, you will notice that the dataset is in many separate files, each file referring to a different portion of the survey questionnaire (there are also a few files containing \"constructed\" variables, where the World Bank saved you some time and added some variables together for you). You can find a \"data map\" file on the website that tells you which sections of the questionnaire are in which data files. This is done simply to make the data set more manageable and easy to use. And the files are also \"compressed\" or \"zipped\" to save space, so you should double click on the folders and then click the button to \"extract\" the files so that they are no longer compressed. You should also download the survey questionnaires, since they will show you what questions were asked. \n"

    "Let's use income to measure poverty, instead of expenditures. The file `HHINCTL.dta` contains data on total household income, and income from various sources. This is one of those \"constructed\" variables, where the World Bank took all of the separate questions on income from Sections 8.1 to 8.7 on the survey and added them all together to make one variable called totminc, for total monthly income (I could have asked you to do that yourself, but this will save you some time).\n",

    "First, you need to know how many people are in each household. So we will need to use the household roster file (`M8_HROST.dta`), which contains data on each person in the household. This corresponds to Section 1 of the survey questionnaire; for each person in each household, there is a line of data, with information on the person's age, sex, relationship to household head, etc.? R is an object-oriented language (unlike STATA) which means that everything (whether it's a number, a dataframe, a list, a function, or anything else) can be assigned a name and held in memory. To assign an object a name we use this reverse arrow `<-` (which you can read as \"gets\"). If we don't assign a name in a line of code then it will print the output (as in the last line below).\n",
