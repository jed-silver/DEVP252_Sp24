    "\n",
    "Today we are going to go over RCTs somewhat interactively in R, with the hope of building familiarity with the type of analysis you might do on your final projects. As in class, we are going to go over the _Cash or Condition_ paper by Baird et al (2011). Recall that the paper studies a randomized control trial in which teenage girls in Malawi were offered a cash transfer that was either conditional on their school attendance or unconditional or were offered no cash transfer. The outcome we will mostly be looking at today is how each type of transfer `T2a` and `T2b` affected teen pregnancy rates `ever_pregnant`. "

    "## What is an RCT?\n",
    "The main challenge of identifying the causal impact of a policy or program is constructing a valid counterfactual for what would have happened to treated individuals had they not been treated. Of course, we never observe the same individual being both treated and untreated at a given time. So the next best thing we can do is compare groups of people that were statistically identical before the treatment after some of them get the treatment and others don't. We can do this by randomizing who gets treated and who doesn't. If treatment is random, we can be almost positive that the _only_ difference between the treatment and control group is the effect of the treatment, as long as our sample is large enough. \n",
    "\n",
    "When feasible, randomization is the most rigorous approach to construct a treatment and a control group from among an eligible population (see Duflo, 2006; Banerjee and Duflo, 2009).\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we analyze an RCT If we want to know the **average treatment effects ATE** of a program, then all we need to do is compare the average value of our outcome in the treatment group to its average value in the control group.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ ATE = \\bar Y_T - \\bar Y_C$$\n",

    "## A Few Practical Concerns\n",
    "\n",
    "Most household surveys come with sampling weights. These weights assign different importance to different observations (inversely) based on the probability that they were included in the sample. This is because it's not usually feasible to survey a group of people that's exactly representative of the population of interest. But fortunately, surveys come with weights that we can apply in order to make the sample representative of the broader population. We can implement this in R by specifying the column containing our sampling weights `wgt` in the `weights` argument in `felm`. \n",
    "\n",
    "We also want to make sure we're using the right standard errors to conduct statistical inference. The default standard errors we get when we run `felm` or some other regression package are almost never the ones we actually want, because they make unrealistic assumptions about the distribution of the error term. When it comes to RCTs, best practice is to cluster standard errors at the level at which treatment was assigned. (This essentially allows the error term to be arbitrarily correlated within clusters. For example, we might expect unobserved factors affecting pregnancy to more highly correlated among girls from the same village. This generally produces more conservative estimates than unadjusted standard errors). In this case, treatment was assigned at the community level so we can use the variable `eaid` to cluster. We can simply specify this with the `cluster` argument in `felm` (for now at least). \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Re-run your regression applying the appropriate sampling weights. Then also cluster your standard errors at the village level. How does this affect the standard errors? How does this affect the coefficients?"

The key assumption is that the randomization did in fact result in two statistically identicial groups. Unfortunately, we can't test this assumption directly because there are many variables we can't observe. But as a smell test, we can at least test whether observable attributes (that are either measured before the treatment or are fixed) are statistically different between the two groups. \n",
